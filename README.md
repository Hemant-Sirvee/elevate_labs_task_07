# üß© Task 07 ‚Äì Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

This repository contains my submission for **Task 07** of the **Elevate Labs Cyber Security Internship**.  
The task focuses on learning how to **identify, analyze, and remove suspicious or potentially harmful browser extensions** that may compromise system or data security.

---

## üéØ Objective

To inspect all installed browser extensions, analyze their permissions, identify any suspicious or unnecessary extensions, and remove them safely to improve browser security and performance.

---

## üß∞ Tools Used

- **Google Chrome (v141.0)**  
- **Chrome Extensions Manager:** `chrome://extensions`  
- **Mozilla Firefox (optional)**  
- **Online Resources:** Chrome Web Store reviews, developer information, and community feedback  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed

1. **Opened Extension Manager**
   - Accessed Chrome via `chrome://extensions` to list all installed extensions.

2. **Reviewed Installed Extensions**
   - Checked developer details, purpose, ratings, and permissions for each extension.

3. **Identified Suspicious Extensions**
   - Flagged extensions with:
     - Unknown developers  
     - Poor reviews or no feedback  
     - Excessive permissions (e.g., access to all websites or clipboard)

4. **Removed or Disabled the Extension**
   - Disabled first for testing, then permanently removed the suspicious extension (`PDF Converter Pro` in this case).

5. **Restarted Browser**
   - Verified improved browser performance and ensured no unwanted background activities.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Red Flags in Malicious Extensions

- Requests to **access data on all websites**  
- No verified developer or contact information  
- Unusual **permissions** such as clipboard, downloads, or cookies access  
- Negative or **fake user reviews**  
- Redirecting or inserting ads in unrelated websites  

---

## üß† Key Learnings

- Learned how browser extensions can become attack vectors for **data theft or tracking**.  
- Understood the importance of checking **permissions** before installation.  
- Removing unused or unverified extensions significantly improves **privacy and browser performance**.  
- Regular audits of extensions help maintain a **secure browsing environment**.  
- Awareness that even a single malicious extension can lead to **account compromise or credential leaks**.
